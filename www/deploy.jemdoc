= Deploy


Deploying to github is easy, if youre folder is already a github repo

~~~
{}{shell}
./deploy ./www
~~~
from the root folder, and the argument specifies the folder to build.

If this doesnt work, try giving it executable permissions first:
~~~
{}{shell}
chmod +x deploy.sh
~~~
and then try again.

*Settings*

You just need to specify some of the settings. 

See +deploy.sh+ for details.
